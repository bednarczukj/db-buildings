## CI/CD

This project uses **GitHub Actions** for continuous integration and deployment.

### Pipeline Overview

The CI/CD pipeline automatically runs on:

- Push to `master` branch
- Pull requests to `master`
- Manual trigger via GitHub Actions UI

### What's Tested

- âœ… **Lint & Code Quality** - ESLint and Prettier checks
- âœ… **Unit Tests** - Vitest with coverage reporting
- âœ… **Production Build** - Verifies production build succeeds

### Getting Started

To set up CI/CD for your fork:

1. **Quick Start:** Read [`.github/SETUP-GUIDE.md`](.github/SETUP-GUIDE.md) for step-by-step instructions
2. **Technical Docs:** See [`.github/README.md`](.github/README.md) for detailed documentation
3. **Architecture:** Check [`.github/ARCHITECTURE.md`](.github/ARCHITECTURE.md) for diagrams and details

### Required Secrets

Add these secrets in GitHub `Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions`:

- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Your Supabase anonymous key
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Your Supabase service role key

See [`.github/SETUP-GUIDE.md`](.github/SETUP-GUIDE.md) for more details.

## API Documentation

API endpoints are documented in the `.ai/` directory:

- **GET /api/v1/buildings** - [Full documentation](.ai/api-endpoint-buildings-get.md)
  - List buildings with filtering and pagination
  - Supports filters: voivodeship, district, community, city, provider, status
- **POST /api/v1/buildings** - [Full documentation](.ai/api-endpoint-buildings-post.md)
  - Create a new building
  - Validates TERYT codes and coordinates
  - Checks for duplicates

- **GET /api/v1/buildings/:id** - [Full documentation](.ai/api-endpoint-building-by-id.md)
  - Get single building by ID
  - Fast primary key lookup
  - Returns 404 if not found

For HTTP request examples, see [API Examples](.ai/api-examples.http).

### Testing

To test the API endpoints:

1. Start the server: `npm run dev`
2. Run the test script: `./.ai/test-get-by-id.sh`
3. Or see [Test Examples](.ai/test-results-example.md) for expected results

For more details on using mock data in development and testing, see [Mock Data README](src/lib/mocks/README.md).

## Project Scope

### In Scope (MVP)

- Manual entry and CRUD of building records with:
  - Building number, type, TERYT hierarchy (voivodeship â†’ county â†’ commune â†’ locality â†’ district/part (optional) â†’ street (optional))
  - Coordinates (WGS84), broadband provider data (name, technology, throughput)
- CRUD for TERYT dictionaries (voivodeships, counties, communes, localities, parts/districts, streets)
- Role-based access:
  - `ADMIN`: manage users and roles
  - `WRITE`: create, update, delete buildings and dictionaries
  - `READ`: view only
- Supabase Auth with HttpOnly secure cookies and session timeout
- Autocomplete search (min. 2 chars, 300 ms debounce)
- Public REST API v1:
  - Read building parameters (coordinates, provider, technology, throughput)
  - API keys with rotation, rate limit 10 req/hr, `Idempotency-Key`, HTTP 429/`Retry-After`
  - Pagination (`page`, `pageSize`)
- Audit logging (filters, pagination, retention 365 days)
- Hard delete with confirmation modal
- Optimistic locking and unique constraints

### Out of Scope (MVP)

- Automatic data imports or external integrations
- Bulk upload of building data
- External provider dictionary (entered manually)
- Backup UI and enforcement of HTTPS/CORS/SLA
