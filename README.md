## Project Scope

### In Scope (MVP)

- Manual entry and CRUD of building records with:
  - Building number, type, TERYT hierarchy (voivodeship â†’ county â†’ commune â†’ locality â†’ district/part (optional) â†’ street (optional))
  - Coordinates (WGS84), broadband provider data (name, technology, throughput)
- CRUD for TERYT dictionaries (voivodeships, counties, communes, localities, parts/districts, streets)
- Role-based access:
  - `ADMIN`: manage users and roles  
  - `WRITE`: create, update, delete buildings and dictionaries  
  - `READ`: view only  
- Supabase Auth with HttpOnly secure cookies and session timeout
- Autocomplete search (min. 2 chars, 300 ms debounce)
- Public REST API v1:
  - Read building parameters (coordinates, provider, technology, throughput)
  - API keys with rotation, rate limit 10 req/hr, `Idempotency-Key`, HTTP 429/`Retry-After`
  - Pagination (`page`, `pageSize`)
- Audit logging (filters, pagination, retention 365 days)
- Hard delete with confirmation modal
- Optimistic locking and unique constraints

### Out of Scope (MVP)

- Automatic data imports or external integrations
- Bulk upload of building data
- External provider dictionary (entered manually)
